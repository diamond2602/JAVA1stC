What is Java --> Java is a programming language which helps people to communicate
with the computer(program).(BRIDGE BETWEEN HUMAN AND COMPUTER)
Possible Interview Questions:
1)What is JDK, JVM, and JRE?
2)What do you know about JDK, JVM and JRE(American Style)
3) There is no possible directly asking questions about PRIMITIVE but most of the
technical questions require Primitive DATA

JDK:JAVA DEVELOPMENT KID--> is a sofware development kit required to develop application
in java with specific libraries.
JRE:JAVA RUN TIME ENVIRONMENT-->is a set of software tools responsible for EXECUTION.
JVM: JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE:is responsible for CONVERTING BYTE CODE TO BINARY CODE
to the machine.

PRIMITIVE DATA: is a way to store data and reuse it.

WHOLE  NUMBERS:
int -->
byte
long
short

DECIMAL NUMBER:
double
float

CONDITION
Boolean; TRUE OR FALSE

ChARACTER:
Char--> ASCII TABLE

ASCII TABLE:
is the table that contains all of the characters(numbers, symbols,letter etc..)

short a = 5;
short b= 6;
short c=a+b;
sout(c);

        short b = 6;
        short c = (short) (a + b);//this is going to give you compile time error because whenever
        //do any work with below int. It will automatically converts to the int
        char letter = 65;//ascii table something
        char letter2 = 'g'; // g
        System.out.println(c);
