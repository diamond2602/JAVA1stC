    INTERVIEW QUESTION:
    1)What is the difference between Array and ArrayList ?

    ARRAY:
   *1)Array has fixed size
    2)Arrays store object and primitive data
    *3)Array doesn't have methods and it has length
    4)Array has multidimensional form
    5)The synthax of Array is int array[] = new int[3];
                                int array[] = {1,2,3};


    ARRAYLIST:
    1)Array is flexible size.
    2)Array List stores only objects.
    3)Array List has methods(like add, replace,remove..) + it has size instead of length
    4)Array List doesn't have the multidimensional form
    5)Synthax is ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList();
