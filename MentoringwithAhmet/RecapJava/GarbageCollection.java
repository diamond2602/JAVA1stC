      1*)How can you prove that gc is working
      To call the finalize method(protected) public.
      2*)How can you make the object garbage
      By assign the null value
      By reassign with the different value;-->please check the example above
      3*)Can you call gc many times? *(OCA);
      You can only call 1 time
      4)Do you have to call gc to clean up your codes?
      No, because it works all the time automatically.
